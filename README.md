In our project, implementation has modified and re-distribute the [minFunc optimization package](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc.html) and the [matlab kmeans demo of paper "Analysis of Single Layer Unsupervised Feature Learning"](http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nipsdlufl10-AnalysisSingleLayerUnsupervisedFeatureLearning.pdf).
